They were to eventually form a band, write and create songs that they performed at various venues. However, really it's all about the girls eating snacks and having whacky fun. <br><br>The <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpA_B5khZc'>OP of K-On!</a> is one I think I will never skip, it's so energetic and fun, definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it. The ED wasn't anything spectacular music wise, but the art was great.</div></div>" > content/opinions/anime.txt
